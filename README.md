# Live_London_Weather_Update_using_ROS_Launch
In this project, we have developed a same system as given in chapter one but with the use of ‘Launch’ feature of ROS. Launch files provide a convenient way to start up multiple nodes and a master, as well as other initialization requirements such as setting parameters. Also it automatically start roscore if it detects that it is not already running.
